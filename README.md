# My Other Unity Projects
Various Unity projects of my own, or based on tutorials/examples etc.

### Own projects:
- Tabula Lusoria - based on a simple ancient Roman game for 2 players, made to learn/test online functionality
- Mandelbrot CPU - real-time Mandelbrot Set visualisation running on CPU (very slowly, GPU version [here](https://github.com/MatJab94/mandelbrot))
- Custom 3D Character Controller - a simple controller for a third person perspective character with jumping, crouching, moving platforms, shootable boxes, power-ups, climbing up stairs and detecting ledges to not fall down from too high
